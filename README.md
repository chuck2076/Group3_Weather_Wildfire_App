# Purpose

Weather & Fire Tracker is an application that renders real time data from three unique API servers for selected national park you might be planning to visit. Our purpose was to allow anyone traveling to designated area to be aware of real time weather and potential forrest fire hazards when planning a trip. In recent years, natural forrest fires have been burning rampant. We also envisioned our applications potential to be useful to any Fire & Rescue services that may need data for locations in the area with abnormally high wildfire danger ratings.
